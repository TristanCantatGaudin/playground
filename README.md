Miscellaneous scripts and notebooks for data scraping, visualisation, statistics, machine learning.



## Statistics

[algebra_fitting_polynomials](/statistics/algebra_fitting_polynomials.ipynb) - ordinary and generalised least squares, with a full matrix of covariance, and covariance on the best-fit result

[algebra_mean_with_correlations](/statistics/algebra_mean_with_correlations.ipynb) - spelled out math to compute the mean (and associated covariance matrix describe its uncertainty) for data with correlated errors

[prior_likelihood_conflict](/statistics/prior_likelihood_conflict.ipynb) - illustration of the combination of Gaussians and t-distributions (as likelihoods, or prior-likelihood), showing the importance of the behaviour of the tails.



## Data science

Examples using Python libraries for data scraping, cleaning, visualisation, processing.

[geotagged_photos_venezia](geotagged_photos_venezia.ipynb) - FlickrAPI, convert date+time strings to `datetime` objects, get dayofyear, dayofweek etc.

[rookies_bball_ref_2024_race](/nba/rookies_bball_ref_2024_race.ipynb) - urllib and BeautifulSoup to get html tags from a table, pandas to read tables from multiple pages

[scrape_all_rookie_stats](/nba/scrape_all_rookie_stats.ipynb) - pandas to read tables, flatten nested columns
